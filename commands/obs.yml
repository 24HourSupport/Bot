    **We do not provide support here for GeForce Experience/Shadowplay related issues.** The software is extremely unreliable and breaks for no apparent reason with no easily known fixes. As a result, it is not worth our time or effort to fix it.

    The only recommendation you will get from regular assistants here is to use OBS.

    Read the wiki entry for instructions on where to get help with anything related to GFE, such as Shadowplay.
 - "If you want more information on how to setup OBS to record all the time and use instant replay, follow "
