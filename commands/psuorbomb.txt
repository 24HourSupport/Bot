Explains why to not cheap out on a PSU + link to tierlist
A PSU is one of the few components you absolutely SHOULD NOT cheap out on. A bad PSU can easily kill your entire system and be a potential fire hazard.

When purchasing a PSU, consult this list:  https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/1116640-psucultists-psu-tier-list/

Ideally get nothing lower than tier A and B. Anything lower than tier C is a fire hazard.
