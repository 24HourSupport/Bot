description: CMOS reset
message: |-
    Do a CMOS reset by removing the CMOS battery and disconnecting the PSU (Power Supply Unit) from the wall outlet (power plug from wall), leaving both disconnected and out for 30 minutes at the same time. After 30 minutes put the CMOS battery back in then connect the power supply again.
    
    If you can't find the CMOS battery, look to see if it's under your GPU.
    
    Gif shows how to take it out **and** put it back in, be careful with the screwdriver **not to scratch** the motherboard! You can put it back in with your finger! While the gif does not show it (lazy!) **you need to completely remove the CMOS battery from the computer!** You cannot leave it in the case, you can put it outside and place it on a non-metal surface!
    
    Reminder of everything you have to do in order:
    
    1. Remove CMOS battery **and** disconnect PSU from your electrical outlet
    2. Leave **both at the same time** removed and disconnected for **30 minutes**
    3. **After** the **full 30 minutes have passed** then you put it in. Please do not skip steps or be inpatient. This simple thing can often fix issues but it can only do so **if you follow the steps here and be patient**, you being inpatient can cost you more time fixing an issue with other steps, which wouldn't have happened if you instead simply waited.
