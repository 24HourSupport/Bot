description: Smartscreen complains about Automator
message:
 - "If you see the 'Windows protected your PC, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented and unrecognized app' warning when you ran the 24HS-Automator, this is nothing to be concerned about. If Windows Defender actually detected a virus then it wouldn't even show this, but instead block the download."
 - text: This warning happens when an app developer refuses to pay Microsoft's $600 a year license to make the warning go away

    "It has nothing to do with it detecting anything malicious, but instead just Microsoft trying to force app developers to pay their fee or else this scary warning shows up. All you have to do is click 'More info', then 'Run anyway'. If you have doubts that this is a virus, then go ahead and scan it with your anti-virus of choice."
