    You should NOT use the following games as benchmarks or to see if your PC has a problem.
    
    1. Escape from Tarkov
    2. Valorant
    3. Fortnite
    4. Ark Survival
    5. Cyberpunk 2077
    6. Warzone
    7. DayZ
    8. PUBG
    9. All Bethesda games
    10. Minecraft
    11. Rust
    12. Rocket League
    
    
    
    But **Why?**
    
    Because all these games are unoptimized, have scalability issues and are made by incompetent devs. You can have better hardware than someone else running the same game and have issues.
