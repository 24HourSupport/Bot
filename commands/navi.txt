Very big message explaining why Navi GPUs are bad
Where do I start.. uhh..

If you just bought a Navi GPU (5300, 5300 XT, 5500, 5500 XT, 5600, 5600 XT, 5700, 5700 XT) please refund it now. More information down below, even if you bought it months ago and it is past the refund period know that Amazon generally is refunding Navi GPUs regardless of that period if you ask hard enough. They may offer you a partial refund at first if you push hard enough, deny this saying the GPU is not working properly and you need a full refund. If they offer you a replacement deny it, as a replacement will not fix driver issues.

Before getting into driver issues (which you will encounter, not a matter of *if* ) the Navi GPUs do not support features that upcoming games will be using, such as DirectX12 Ultimate ( https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/announcing-directx-12-ultimate/ ) , Ray Tracing, DLSS 2.0 ( https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-dlss-2-performance-benchmarks-control-wolfenstein-youngblood/ ).

The driver issues alongside their lackluster futureproofness worsens the issue: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/381797319005175809/766405117502160896/2020-02-13-image.jpeg

Half of your users having issues is not acceptable. There are issues reported by hundreds that have been open for over a year: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/892

At this point here we don't even bother offering support for these GPUs, they are unfixable. Only "workarounds" are to use the CPU whenever possible. REFUND THIS GPU. 

AMD's driver team is made up of incompetent people. As an example the 5700 XT released on July 9th 2019, the drivers weren't even done being reviewed on June 17th 2019: https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=AMD-Navi-10-Linux-Kernel-Patch

Intel as an example finishes their drivers A YEAR before they release the product: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/2521

Polaris drivers took around 2-3 years to become stable, buy Navi in 3 years.
